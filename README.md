# NBA-Fantasy-League
This is a Machine Learning projection model for NBA player statistics using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn. The project is still in progress; I will use a kNN-inspired algorithm to select the two best players (statistics-wise) and ten additional players that are similar in projected statistics. The model will be evaluated with RMSE.
